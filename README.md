Hey there! 

I'm a software engineer with over three years of experience under my belt. I mostly work with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript for web development projects. What I'm really passionate about is creating solutions that make a positive impact in people's lives, whether it's streamlining processes, increasing efficiency, or solving tough problems.

Currently, I'm working in [Hibob](https://hibob.com) as a backend software engineer building a learning management system that's integrated with a human resource management system, using programming languages like Ruby, Kotlin, and Scala.

I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I'm excited to use my skills and expertise to make a difference in the world.
