Hello i'm _Gab_, a web developer based in Brazil


Currently working as a web developer at [Bugle](https://www.trybugle.com/), where I work as a backend developer using Ruby on Rails.


I am a very curious person who is always testing new technologies just for fun, i'm also interested in automation and infrastructure (preferably both together, because I'm a lazy person :joy:)
